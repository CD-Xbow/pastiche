## Getting Started
Pastiche AI Studio offers two powerful modes for creating stunning images:

### Generate: Create images from text descriptions
Edit Image: Upload an image and transform it with AI

- Photographic Styles
- Artistic Styles
- Printing Styles
- Drawing Styles
- Cartoon Styles

## Image Editing Tips
Style Transfer
Upload an image and describe a style (e.g., "make it look like a watercolor painting") to transform it while keeping the original composition.

## Adding Elements
Describe what you want to add (e.g., "add a sunset in the background" or "put the person in a futuristic city") to enhance your uploaded image.

## Image Variations
Use prompts like "create a variation of this image" or "reimagine this scene" to generate creative alternatives based on your upload.

## Best Practices
- Be Specific
- Detailed prompts yield better results. Include subject, setting, style, mood, and lighting.

## Use Style Presets
- Select a style preset to give the AI clear direction about the aesthetic you want.

## Experiment
- Try different prompts and styles. Small wording changes can produce very different results.

## Image Quality
- For editing mode, upload high-quality images for best results. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
